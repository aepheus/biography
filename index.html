				I enjoy a balance of people responsibility and software development leadership. I love to code and build things. I've come to the point in my life where I've realized that it's much more rewarding to increase the productivity of others rather than trying to further increase my own productivity from a coding perspective. That doesn't mean I don't continuously learn myself, but rather that my focus has changed from myself to others. I mentor developers and help them find and improve their areas of interest in software development. I find the details of running a software project interesting, and am continuously looking at ways to improve development processes.
